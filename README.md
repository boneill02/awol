# AWOL

A 2D top down survival game.

## Building

```
make
sudo make install
```

## Playing

There is no goal at the moment nor many features. WASD keys move around.
That's all you can do at the moment. The art is definitely not final. This is
a hobby project to play around and practice programming, not meant to be a big
successful game, so don't expect much. Maybe you can learn something from the
code though!
